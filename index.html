								<p>Hello, my name is Shizhen Jiang. Please call me John, because I know it may be hard for you to pronounce that. My student number is 3587119, and the email address is s3587119@student.rmit.edu.au. As you can see from my name, I am from China. I was born in Shenzhen, a city where near to Hongkong, but I only can speak Mandarin, and English. I am the second child of my family. Because of the one-child policy, my parents lost their job in the hospital. However, they always tell me it is lucky to have me so that they could start their own business. They were happy to have their own business because it was their dreams.  </p>
								<p>For my hobbies, I like sports, but my favourite one is basketball. At spare time, I like to play some PC games, such as civilization VI and NBA2K. Also, I like traveling. I have been to many countries, and Cuba is the best place I have visited. My last hobby is investing, I used to earn some money (also lost most of them) from stock market, and now I put my money on real estates because stock market is a little bit too unpredictable to me.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This job is being a business analyst for ANZ bank. The first reason why I choose this job as my ideal job is that I want to be a business analyst in the future. Also, I am studying business information in university, so it will help me to learn some skills in order to take that job. Another reason is currently many businesses, especially traditional business, needs a business analyst to help them to develop their business to become more digital. I think business analyst will become more and more important in the future since business needs continue to be updated by new technology, such as AI.  </p>
								<p>To get this job, it requires several skills. Firstly, it needs strong user story mapping skills and abilities to gather, analyze and present large quantities of data. Secondly, it requires to work in pressure and know how to work with a team effectively. In addition, communication, written, and interpersonal skills are important in this job. At last, relevant experience in Business Analysis tasks and techniques is quite essential. </p>
								<p>Currently, I do not have qualified skills to get this job. I think I have reasonable skills in data management since I have good marks on this subject. For user story mapping abilities, I think I have average skill. Moreover, I do not have any experience of being a business analyst.</p>
								<p>Although I do not have enough skills and experiences now, but I will have a plan to get this job. I will keep increase users story mapping skills and data analyzing skills by internship because I think more practical cases and practices will help me to master skills and also gain experiences. After graduating, I want to find a job related to business analyst, such as data manager, to learn more about data analyzing and problem-solving skills. </P>

								<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h3>
								<p>Because of these results, I understand better about myself. I think the result of 16 personality test is accurate. My personality is "defender", and defenders are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging the work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity. I become more confident about myself because of the compliment of this personality. However, the results also address my weakness, which is too altruistic and overload myself. </p>
								<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behavior in a team?</h3>
								<p>The results will definitely influence my behavior in a team because I know my strength and weakness now. I will not put too much pressure on me, and start to care about myself. In the past, I will take the hardest work in a team assignment, and now I will prefer to divide the work equally. I will not take things too personally anymore so anything bad at workplace will not affect my personal life in the future.</p>
								<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
								<p>Firstly, I will tell everyone in the team what my personality is. Moreover, I will introduce my personality including strength and weakness. I think being open and honest is always a good option to let people trust me. Then, I will suggest having a discussion about the assignment plan to divide the work equally. I will try my best to talk more rather not being quiet and shy.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<h3>What is my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</h3>
							  <p>My interest in IT is data governance and artificial intelligence. I found this interest when I was studying business data management. The tutor who taught this subject finds I was interested in SQL and said I could be a database manager in the future.</p>
								<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
								<p>I choose RMIT because RMIT is a good university, and I have friends here too. RMIT has some creative buildings, and the campus is in the city which I think is very convenient. The most important reason is I heard my friends said the test in RMIT is reasonable and not hard. I hate hard tests so I choose RMIT. </p>
								<h3>What do I expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
								<p>I expect to learn some IT knowledge, but most importantly, I want to learn how to work with IT people in this course since I am business students, and I want to be a business analyst in future. I want to participate in their subject</p>

								<h2 class="major">My Project "Plan my Uni"</h2>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>“Plan my Uni” is a mobile device application which will use AI and machine learning technology to build a personalized and unique study plan for a student.  The plan will divide the total work in one semester to specific tasks into students’ work planner, by analyzing each student's preference, lifestyle, the difficulty of assignment and other possible factors. Besides, "Plan my Uni" will provide the most related events suggestions inside and outside the university, such as “Orientation Week” for new students, to help students to integrate into their university life. The aim of “Plan my Uni” is to assist students to achieve their academic success through a personalised and organised plan. </p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>There has been an increase in the discussion of student success over recent years in the IT area and higher education institutes with every indication that this concern will continue to expand. According to Grajek and the 2018–2019 EDUCAUSE IT Issues Panel (2019), how to apply new technology, such as AI, to help students achieve success is in the list of “2019 top 10 IT issues”, and many universities are trying to use new technologies to become a Student-Centred Institution. Moreover, as a university student and a student mentor, there are some ridiculous but common, chaotic planning problems that happen in a university student’s life. For instance, an anxious mentee shows up in the SLAM’s room with an assignment that is due on that day, but he had to do other assignments first. Therefore, “Plan my Uni” will help universities assist students because it is an ideal study tool to plan work more efficiently.  </p>
								<h3>Discription</h3>
								<p>The first and the most critical feature of "Plan my Uni" is generating a suitable and personalized plan for the student. "Plan my Uni" is not a simple plain timetable that schedules manually by the student; in contrast, the majority of study schedule will be done by AI system. “Plan my Uni” will have a user test to collect information from the user, and access the student, assignments and all relevant data from university to analysis their study behavior and preferences after getting permission from students and institute (safety policy and corporation policy from universities). All the collected information enable the system to divide and allocate different works into a personalized and well-organized routine timetable to help the student to follow their assignment and ease their workload when it is close to due date.  </p>
								<p>The second feature is the events suggestions system. "Plan my Uni" is not only just a timetable for study but also aim to help students to participate actively in their university life. Participation of society is another critical factor to student success rather than just academic success; additionally, events, such as volunteering and clubs' activities, will help students to learn valuable experience before their graduating. Therefore, the event suggestion system will show a variety of related activities based on the student’s information and put the selected event into their plan.</p>
								<p>In order to motivate students to follow the plan, "Plan my Uni" has a motivation feature. This feature contains student rating system and awards system. To be more specific, the rating system is slimmer to the level-up system of some RPG game. There are a bronze, silver, gold, diamond title, and each title have ten levels. For example, every new user will have a title of identities, such as L1 bronze, and an experience bar. When students finish their work on time, they will gain some experiences into an experience bar. When experience bar is full, students will level up and gain a new title, such as L2 bronze. For rewards system, if students gain a new title, he will also have some rewards. There are plenty of kinds of rewards, such as discounts coupon of retail stores which university students need.</p>
                <p>Moreover, rewards can be stored as credits, and it is called “unicoin”. Students can use “unicoin” to purchase small gifts from pop-up gifts store in the university. With this feature, “Plan my Uni” can make student fell interesting and get motivated while they study to ensure students to follow the plan and motivate them as best as it can. </p>
								<p>Another exciting feature of "Plan my Uni" is connecting students based on their similar or complementary information. There are huge differences between universities and high schools.  Hoyt (2018) stated that in high school, most students know everyone in the class, but a student is lucky to know one person in the university class. Because of extensive collected data of students, “Plan my Uni” will provide users a friend list based on the data. For example, An IT student can view the suggestion list of other students who have the same lectures or tutorials. This feature will connect students together, and increase their relationship. </p>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
								<p>Firstly, as a mobile application, “Plan my Uni” needs a programming software to write it.  Python should be a suitable programming tool to do this task. Secondly, “Plan my Uni” also require several infrastructures of artificial intelligence to run it. At this stage, Python is the programming software to write the code. However, the most important thing is data and data storage. "Plan my Uni" will use the data from the database center that universities are currently used, and have own database hardware to support the application.  </p>
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>“Plan my Uni” is a project that requires high-level programming skills to make it; therefore, it needs a team or even more. People who work the project should master python and all other possible computing skills. Moreover, a database manager is essential because the project also requires data management. Finding people with these skills can be a challenge, but it is possible since the project will be provided to governments departures or high-education institutions. These organizations will have enough human resources and funds to accomplish this project.  </p>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If "Plan my Uni" is successful, it will be huge progress for universities to become a student-centered institution. With “Plan my Uni”, students will have a plan that is designed by their data. They will find that their lifes become more relaxed because they always have an organized and scientific plan. Moreover, “Plan my Uni" not only can help students to achieve their academic success but also help them to build a friendship with others and participate in their university events. In general, "Plan my Uni" will be a worthy project to bring high-education to the future.  </p>
