								<p>Hello, my name is Shizhen Jiang. Please call me John, because I know it may be hard for you to pronounce that. My student number is 3587119, and email address is s3587119@student.rmit.edu.au. As you can see from my name, I am from China. I was born in Shenzhen, a city where near to Hongkong, but I only can speak Mandarin, and English. I am second child of my family. Because of one-child policy, my parents lost their job in the hospital. However, they always tell me it is lucky to have me because they started their own business after losing job. They were happy to have their own business because it was their dreams.  </p>
								<p>For my hobbies, I like sports, but my favourite one is basketball. At spare time, I like to play some PC games, such as civilization VI and NBA2K. Also, I like traveling. I have been to many countries, and Cuba is the best place I have visited. My last hobby is investing, I used to earn some money (also lost most of them) from stock market, and now I put my money on real estates because stock market is little bit too unpredictable to me.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This job is being a business analyst for ANZ bank. The first reason why I choose this job as my ideal job is that I want to be a business analyst in the future. Also, I am studying business information in university, so it will help me to learn some skills in order to take that job. Another reason is currently many business, especially traditional business, needs business analyst to help them to develop their business to become more digital. I think business analyst will become more and more important in the future since business needs continually to be update by new technology, such as AI.  </p>
								<p>To get this job, it requires several skills. Firstly, it needs strong user story mapping skills and abilities to gather, analyse and present large quantities of data. Secondly, it requires to work in pressure and know how to work with a team effectively. In addition, communication, written, and interpersonal skills is important in this job. At last, relevant experience in Business Analysis tasks and techniques is quite essential. </p>
								<p>Currently, I do not have qualified skills to get this job. I think I have reasonable skills of data management since I have good marks on this subject. For user story mapping abilities, I think I have average skill. Moreover, I do not have any experience of being business analyst. </p>
								<p>Although I do not have enough skills and experiences now, but I will have a plan to get this job. I will keep increase users story mapping skills and data analysing skills by internship because I think more practical cases and practices will help me to master skills and also gain experiences. After graduating, I want to find a job that related to business analyst, such as data manager, to learn more about data analysing and problem-solving skills. </P>

								<h2 class="major">My Project "Plan ur Uni"</h2>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>“Plan ur Uni” is a mobile device application which use AI and machine learning technology to build a personalized and unique study plan for a student.  The plan will divide the total work in one semester to specific tasks into students’ routine work planner, by analysing each student’s preference, life style, difficulty of assignment and other possible factors. In addition, “Plan ur Uni” will provide the most related events suggestion inside the university and outside the university, such as “Orientation Week” for new students, to help students to Integrate into their university life. The aim of “Plan ur Uni” is to assist students to achieve their academic success through a personalized and organized plan. </p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>There has been an increase in the discussion of student success over recent years in IT area and high education institutes with every indication that this concern will continue to expand. According to Grajek and the 2018–2019 EDUCAUSE IT Issues Panel (2019), how to apply new technology, such as AI, to help students to success is in the list of “2019 top 10 IT issue”, and many universities are try to use new technology to become a Student-Cantered Institution. Moreover, as a university student and a student mentor, there are some ridiculers but common chaotic planning problems that happen in university student’s life. For instance, an anxious mentee showed in the SLAM with an assignment that is due on that day, but he had to do other assignments first. Therefore, “Plan ur Uni” will help universities to optimizing the student experience because it is an ideal study tools to help students to plan their work more scientifically.  </p>
								<h3>Discription</h3>
								<p>The first and the most important feature of “Plan ur Uni” is generating suitable and personalized plan for student. “Plan ur Uni” is not a simple plain timetable that schedule manually by student; in contrast, the majority of study schedule will be done by AI system. “Plan ur Uni” will have a user test to collect information from the user, and access the student, assignments and all relevant data from university to analysis their study behaviour and preferences after get permission from students and institute (safety policy and corporation policy from universities). All the collected information enable the system to divide and allocate different works into a personalized and well-organized routine timetable to help student to follow their assignment and ease their work load when it is close to due date. </p>
								<p>The second feature is event suggestion system. “Plan ur Uni” is not only just a timetable for study, but also aim to help student to participate actively to their university life. Participation of society is another important factor to student success rather than just academic success; additionally, events, such as volunteering and clubs’ activities, will help students to learn valuable experience before their graduating. Therefore, event suggestion system will show variety of related activities based on the student’s information, and put the selected event into planner. </p>
								<p>In order to motivate students to follow the plan, “Plan ur Uni” has a motivation feature. This feature contains student rating system and awards system. To be more specific, rating system are slimier to the level-up system of some RPG game. There are bronze, silver, gold, diamond title, and each title have 10 levels. For example, every new user will have a title of identity, such as L1 bronze, and an experience bar. When students finish their work on time, they will gain some experiences into experience bar. When experience bar is full, students will level up and gain a new title, such as L2 bronze. For rewards system, if students gain a new title, he will also have some rewards. There are plenty kinds of rewards, such as discounts coupon of retail stores which university students actually need. Moreover, rewards can be stored as credits, and it is called “unicoin”. Students can use “unicoin” to purchase small gifts from pop-up gifts store in the university. With this feature, “Plan ur Uni” can make student to fell interesting and get motivated while they study to ensure students to follow the plan and motivate them as best as it can. </p>
								<p>Another interesting feature of “Plan ur Uni” is connecting students based on their similar or complementary information. There are huge differences between universities and high schools.  Hoyt (2018) stated that in high school, most students know everyone in the class, but a student is lucky to know one person in the university class. Because of massive collected data of students, “Plan ur Uni” will provide users a friend list based on the data. For example, An IT student can view the suggestion list of others students who have same lectures or tutorials. This feature will connect students together, and increase their relationship. </p>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
								<p>Firstly, as a mobile application, “Plan ur Uni” needs a programming software to write it.  Python should be a suitable programming tool to do this task. Secondly, “Plan ur Uni” also require several infrastructures of artificial intelligence to run it. At this stage, Python is the programming software to write the code. However, the most important thing is data and data storage. “Plan ur Uni” will use the data from the database centre that universities are currently used, and have own database hardware to support the application. </p>
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>“Plan ur Uni” is a project that requires high-level programming skills to make it; therefore, it needs a team or even more. People who work the project should master python and all other possible computing skills. Moreover, database manager is essential because the project also requires data management. Finding people with these skills can be a challenge, but it is possible since the project will be provided to governments departures or high-education institutions. These organizations will have enough human resources and funds to accomplish this project.  </p>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If “Plan ur Uni” is successful, it will be a huge progress for universities to become student-cantered institution. With “Plan ur Uni”, students will have a plan that is designed by their data. They will find their life become more relaxed because they always have an organized and scientific plan. Moreover, “Plan ur Uni” not only can help students to achieve their academic success, but also help them to build friendship with others and participate in their university events. In general, “Plan ur Uni” will be a worthy project to bring high-education to the future. </p>
